# 15 Matchsticks Game

There are 15 matchsticks on the table. Players take turns. A player can take out 1 or 2 or 3 matchsticks. The player that takes the last matchstick lost. The PC player is programmed to win, but it starts the game randomly, so the human player does not guess what is the winning strategy easily after several rounds. Besides the OOP Java code (which is nicely extensible and reusable), this program also demonstrates and explains:

• Why we do not close a Scanner(System.in) object.

• What are singleton classes and how to implement the eager initialization and the lazy initialization.

• Behaviour of Scanner when InputMismatchException is thrown.

• How to use return within if/else conditions.

• Real life usage of Random class and modulo.
